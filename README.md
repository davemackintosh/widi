# Widi

This is just a simple lib for now, it doesn't do much but it does make it a bit easier.  

Web Midi, a *tiny* library __horribly__ bloated by all the shims needed for ES6 browser support. Yay JS...  

Makes connecting MIDI devices to web behaviour easy, see the [examples](examples/) folder.  

# Developing

`make watch` to run a build every second if it changed.
